    <h2>Add indentation / spaces between words</h2>

    <p>
      By default, additional spaces are collapsed. This means that if multiple
      spaces are adjacent, only one space is preserved. To create spaces that
      will not be collapsed, you can use tabs instead. Simply press the <kbd
        >Tab</kbd
      > key a few times on your keyboard to create additional spaces between words.
      Be mindful of the use of these spaces.
