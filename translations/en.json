  "home.description": "We aim at archiving and translating all of <strong>Yoko Taro</strong>’s works.<br />Yoko Taro is a Japanese video game director and scenario writer. He is best-known for his involvement with the <strong>NieR</strong > and <strong>Drakengard</strong> series. To complement his games, Yoko Taro likes to publish side materials in the form of books, anime, manga, audio books, novellas, even theater plays.<br />These media can be very difficult to find. His work goes all the way back to 2003. Most of it was released solely in Japanese, and sometimes in short supply. So this is what we do here: <strong>discover, archive, translate, and analyze</strong>.",
